# Vulnerability Classification

1. **Non-critical Issues (Quality Assurance Level)**:
   - Adherence to code standards, clarity, syntax correctness, version control, off-chain monitoring, specification adherence, and accurate commenting.

2. **Low Risk Issues**:
   - Non-critical mismatches between intention and implementation.

3. **Medium Risk Issues**:
   - Impacts on protocol functionality or availability without direct asset risk. Theoretical value leak under specific assumptions.
   - Deviation from intended functionality due to edge cases.

4. **High Risk Issues**:
   - Direct or indirect asset risk with a feasible attack path.
  
## Severity Matrix
- **Impact**: Measures the damage from a successful attack, covering technical, economic, and reputation aspects.
- **Likelihood**: Assesses the chance of a vulnerability being discovered and exploited.
- **Severity**: The combined assessment of impact and likelihood.

| Severity               | Impact: High | Impact: Medium | Impact: Low |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Likelihood: High**   | Critical     | High           | Medium      |
| **Likelihood: Medium** | High         | Medium         | Low         |
| **Likelihood: Low**    | Medium       | Low            | Low         |
